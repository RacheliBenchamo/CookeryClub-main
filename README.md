### Regular Users
Regular users have the ability to create, edit, and delete their own recipes. They can comment on any recipe and also delete their own comments. They can rate other users' recipes as well. Pre-registered users in the system are `Racheli`, `Geula`, `Yarin`, `Solange`, `Avigail` and their passwords are the same as their usernames.

### Admin User
The admin user has extended privileges over regular users. They can delete any recipe, delete all comments from a particular recipe, delete individual comments from any recipe, and reset the ratings of any recipe. The admin user credentials are:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Admin`

### Visitors
Visitors, or non-registered users, have read-only access to the application. They can view the home page with all the recipes, and they can search for recipes by the recipe name or the name of the recipe creator. They can also filter recipes based on the difficulty level, preparation time, and category. However, to perform any other action, they will be redirected to the login page.

## Instructions for Use

### Running the Site

On running the site, the user sees six static recipes. Non-registered users can see the home page with all the recipes, but for any other action, they will be redirected to the login page.

### Adding a New Recipe

A registered user can add a new recipe by clicking on the "Add Recipe" button on the home page and following these steps:

1. Enter the recipe name, choose a difficulty level, select categories, enter preparation time in minutes, and add a URL for a suitable image. After this step, the recipe will already exist in the system.

2. Add ingredients needed for the recipe. Once at least one ingredient is added, the user can see the button to add preparation instructions.

### Editing a Recipe

A user can edit their own recipe by clicking on the "view recipe" button then clicking the "edit" button.
The editing process is similar to the recipe creation process.
Editing ingredients allows the user to add, delete, and update ingredients.
